# rust_gfx_breakout
I'm attempting to port a Breakout game from a tutorial series at https://learnopengl.com to Rust.

Joey de Vries wrote the tutorial at https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Setting-up -- it's written in C++ and uses OpenGL directly.

To help myself learn graphics programming and the gfx library, I plan to port the game featured in the tutorial.
I make no claims as to the quality of my code, or whether it can be considered idiomatic Rust (hint: probaly not!).
